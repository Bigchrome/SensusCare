			<p>The key with mood disorders is to prevent relapses. This is done with counseling and medication alterations. The frequency with which patients meet and consult with psychiatrists is often not enough to prevent this. Furthermore, the data psychiatrists manage to extract during interviews with patients are often incomplete, inaccurate, or not representative of the patient’s entire week/month/however long it’s been since last meeting. There is a growing need for tools and ways to embrace monitored patient treatment in order to help a broader range of patients and help them better when they are receiving outpatient treatment. It is known that patients can benefit from tracking their everyday mood and thereby becoming aware of their mental state along with relating this to other things affecting their lives. </p>

	    	<h1>The Solution</br><small>How we are going to solve this problem</small></h1>
			<p>We are building a platform for psychiatrists to remotely monitor patients with mood disorders. The aim is to have daily questionnaires present in an app on patients’ smartphones, which will be used to assess the patient’s mental state. This critical info will be accessible by doctors on a daily basis, while states deemed critical will trigger alerts, notifying psychiatrists of developments.</p>
